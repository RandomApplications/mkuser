# NOTE: The actual download and run script is a bash script which is run via the "bash" command below which is done like this for a couple of reasons:
# - The parent script can be run as "sh" (or "bash" or "zsh") and the actual install script will always be properly run as "bash" without the user having to worry about that in the invocation.
# - The install script needs to be run as root, and running is as a sub-command like this means that we can launch "bash" with "sudo" as needed without the user having to worry about that in the invocation since running
#   "sudo sh <(curl mkuser.sh)" would fail because the process substitution FD would get consumed by "sudo" instead of "sh". This way just "sh <(curl mkuser.sh)" can be run and "sudo" will be added as needed by this script.
# ALSO NOTE: A here-doc IS NOT used since a here-doc would be passed to the "bash" command using standard input (stdin) and we need any stdin from the parent script to be passed though to the actual "mkuser" script that it run in case
# a password is being passed using "--stdin-password" and a using here-doc would prevent/mask that since only a single stdin can exist. This makes quoting more complicated since the whole script must exist within a single quoted string.
